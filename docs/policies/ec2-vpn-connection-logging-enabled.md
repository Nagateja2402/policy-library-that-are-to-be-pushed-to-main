## Description

This control checks whether an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection has Amazon CloudWatch Logs enabled for both tunnels. The control fails if a Site-to-Site VPN connection doesn't have CloudWatch Logs enabled for both tunnels.

AWS Site-to-Site VPN logs provide you with deeper visibility into your Site-to-Site VPN deployments. With this feature, you have access to Site-to-Site VPN connection logs that provide details on IP Security (IPsec) tunnel establishment, Internet Key Exchange (IKE) negotiations, and dead peer detection (DPD) protocol messages. Site-to-Site VPN logs can be published to CloudWatch Logs. This feature provides customers with a single consistent way to access and analyze detailed logs for all of their Site-to-Site VPN connections.

This rule is covered by the [ec2-vpn-connection-logging-enabled](../../policies/ec2-vpn-connection-logging-enabled.sentinel) policy.
